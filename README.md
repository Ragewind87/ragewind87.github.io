# Game Hub Web App

Play the live app here: https://ragewind87.github.io

This project is a client-side board game hub and is still a work in progress.

### Project Goals

The long-term goal is to support asynchronous, turn-based multiplayer gameplay for various board games. I plan to host the final version on Azure.

## Current Games:

### â™ž TSP React Chess

A Chess game built using `React.js` and `Node.js`.

This game was developed as part of my `Team Software Project` course in Fall 2019 at Michigan Technological University. I led a team of three other students (Team Pawn Stars) to build the game from scratch. We're proud of what we accomplished in a single semester with virtually no prior React experience.

The game was a hit on presentation dayâ€”our professor was especially impressed that we implemented the "En passant" rule.

### ðŸŸ¢ Connect Four (In Progress)

A `React`/`TypeScript` implementation of Connect Four.

This version features character selection, including pets and custom artwork created by friends.
